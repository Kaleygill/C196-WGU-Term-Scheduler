How to run program in Android Studio: 
Step 1: Download application. 
Step 2: Click file -> import. 
Step 3: Run program, emulator will start. 


1.  Explain how your application would be different if it were developed for a tablet rather than a phone, including a discussion of fragments and layouts.
When develoing for larger screens, you have a larger amount of space to work with. Fragments help accomidate for these differences. 
They allow the devloper to distiguise between elements and allow the activity to determine which element to display based on the size available. For example, on a phone 
you will have a simpler navigation bar, but with a tablet you have the opportunity for a larger, more detailed nagivation bar. 
The fragments allow the layouts to accomidate for these distinctions. In regards to my application, if it were developed on a tablet, 
there would be more space to stylize the app and add more accessibility.

2.  Identify the minimum and target operating system your application was developed under and is compatible with.
According to my current tests, the minimum/ operating system in Android is 5.1. The project requires 8.0 or higher which is supported, which is the target. 
Based on Androids documentation, API 14 is the minimum to run the calendar views. Which therefore requires that to run the project. Although the user can type
in the desired dated without, formatting and ease of process can cause issues. 

3.  Describe (suggested length of 1–2 paragraphs) the challenges you faced during the development of the mobile application.
One of my biggest challenges was the Notifications. I did not have the formatting correct which caused the notifcation to default to current time and date rather than the 
one selected. I also struggled with the Calendar view, I was able to determine that each Edit Text field needed its own Calendar code. 

4.  Describe (suggested length of 1–2 paragraphs) how you overcame each challenge discussed in part F3.
I overcame the first issue with the course instructor. I overcame the calendar view by doing research on the method and trying to work out why the first calendar view was working
and not the other. It took me a few days, but I realized they each needed their own code. 

5.  Discuss (suggested length of 1–2 paragraphs) what you would do differently if you did the project again.
If I were to do the project again, I would add more features, such as Course instructor appointments. They would have reminder set for the appointment to make it easier for the 
student to keep track. 

6.  Describe how emulators are used and the pros and cons of using an emulator versus using a development device.
Emulators are used to mimick real devices to test your app. The pros of using an emulator is you can test multiple deives and its cheaper compared to a devloped deivce. The cons, you cannot simulate real life situations, 
such as placing a call and other related hardware functionalities.
